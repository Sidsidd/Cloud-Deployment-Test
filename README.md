Initially we need to install Boto3 using pip where boto3 is a library used to create, configure, and manage AWS services.
A VPC with a CIDR block that supports up to 65,536 IP addresses and supports hostnames. Then, a subnet with a CIDR block and up to 256 IP addresses is created within that VPC using Python and the boto3 library.
We should add the internet gateway.
An EC2 instance of type t2.micro with a public IP address is deployed by a security group that allows SSH and HTTP traffic. The name of the key pair that will be used to initiate an SSH connection to the instance is specified by the KeyName parameter.
To install Nginx on the EC2 instance, run the necessary instructions using the SSH client object.
Make a bucket and give it a name. We can use the upload button to add files or directories. Choose the file, confirm that static website hosting is enabled, then use make the file public using ACL.
Then a link is generated in the properties bar, and we may access it for relevant output.

Bucket website endpoint: https://my-project-test-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/proj.py
